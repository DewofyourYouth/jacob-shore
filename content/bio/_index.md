## Short intro

I’m Jacob Shore, a senior software engineer with a background in DevOps and infrastructure.
I work on backend systems, reliability, and data-heavy workflows.
I’m currently based in Israel and open to senior engineering roles.

This site is a personal hub. It collects my projects, writing, and ongoing experiments, both professional and otherwise.

## What I do

My professional work focuses on building and maintaining software systems where clarity and reliability matter. I’ve spent several years working across product and infrastructure boundaries, and I’m comfortable moving between code, tooling, and architecture.

Outside of day jobs, I build small web projects and language-learning tools, and I use writing as a way to think through problems rather than to market myself.

## Résumé (selected experience)

### Software Engineer  
**Backend & Infrastructure-adjacent work**  
*Several years*

- Built and maintained production systems used by real users, with an emphasis on reliability and operational clarity  
- Worked across backend services, internal tooling, and deployment environments  
- Regularly debugged issues spanning application code, configuration, and infrastructure layers  
- Comfortable owning problems end-to-end, from diagnosis to fix to post-mortem  

### Infrastructure & Operations (overlapping responsibilities)

- Worked with containerized environments and modern deployment workflows  
- Improved observability, stability, and developer ergonomics in existing systems  
- Navigated legacy constraints without breaking what already worked  
- Prioritized boring, durable solutions over clever but fragile ones  

### Product-facing Engineering

- Collaborated with non-engineers to translate vague requirements into concrete behavior  
- Shipped incremental improvements rather than large, risky rewrites  
- Balanced delivery pressure with long-term maintainability  

### Prior background  
**Intensive textual study and teaching (pre-tech)**

- Years of disciplined, high-volume study in complex textual systems  
- Developed strong analytical habits, attention to detail, and tolerance for difficult material  
- Experience explaining complex ideas clearly and patiently

## Hobbies & Interests

- Language learning and dialect study (Arabic, Turkish, Hebrew)  
- Writing and personal documentation systems  
- Building small, focused web projects  
- Learning for its own sake, especially through difficult material  
- Systems thinking and tool design  
- Reading history, philosophy, and primary sources  
- Walking, thinking, and unstructured exploration  
- Long-form conversations and careful argument  
- Music as background infrastructure rather than entertainment
